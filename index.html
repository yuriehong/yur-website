            <h2>About Me!</h2>
                <p>Hi! I'm from the Washington D.C. area, where I grew up hiking with my family, playing lacrosse, and exploring coffee shops. I have taken 
                    a few computer science courses in high school and college. I decided to take the Flatiron coding bootcamp course in order to solidify 
                    good software engineering practices and work with other students on coding projects. I decided to switch from premed to 
                    pursure software engineering after working in a clinical setting as a medical assistant and rediscovering my love for coding. 
                    
                    I researched in the Santhanam lab at the Johns Hopkins medical campus for 2 years where I studied the fundamental mechanisms of cardiovascular disease. 
                    In 2019, my biomedical engineering design team at Johns Hopkins designed a novel one-arm-drive mobile stander for pediatric patients 
                    with hemiplegia. Coding languages I am familiar with are Java, Javascript, Python, HTML, CSS, and Matlab.</p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I graduated Spring 2021 with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University.</p>

            <h2>My Experiences</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><em>Design team</em> My team designed a novel one-arm-drive mobile stander. We started working on this project after meeting a teenager with mobility issues due to his impaired legs and arm. 
                    Because of his various disabilities, he experienced difficulties going about routine daily activities. Inspired by his tenacity, we made it our mission to build a stander that will help him and other children improve their mobility. 
                    Several physicians and professors mentored us, providing valuable feedback for our project. The time spent creating presentations for desk review meetings, brainstorming ideas in the design studio, 
                    and collaborating in fun activities such as escape rooms created a strong bond within our team.</li>
